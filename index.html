    <!-- Description of Project-->
    <p>
        Welcome to my landing page for the Web Design Challenge. In this assignmeent,
        we were challenged to create a visualization dashboard with visualizations
        we've created prior to starting this challenge. In doing so, we can show off
        our skills in creating a website using HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of the prior assignment was to analyze how weather changes
        the closer you are to the equator. We gathered data using the OpenWeatherMap
        API as discussed in class, and created a dataset on over 500 cities.
    </p>
    <p>
        After creating the dataset, we used the Matplotlib library in Python to plot
        a number of factors of weather against the latitude of each city. Some of these
        factors included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. I have
        provided the source data and visualizations I created in the previous assignment,
        as well as an descriptions of trends/correlations I saw in doing that assignment.
        You can also see these resources on my
